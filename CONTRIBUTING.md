## Pull Request Guidelines

- **Keep it focused**: Each pull request should address a single issue or feature.
- **Write clear commit messages**: Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.
- **Update documentation**: If you're adding a new feature or changing an existing one, be sure to update the documentation.
- **Add tests**: All new features should have corresponding tests.
- **Ensure tests pass**: Run `go test ./...` before submitting your pull request.
- **Link to an issue**: If your pull request addresses an existing issue, be sure to link to it in the description (e.g., `Fixes #123`).

## Development Setup

> **ðŸ’» Development Tip**: Use a consistent development environment. Consider using Docker for database dependencies to avoid conflicts between different projects.

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or later
- CockroachDB (for local development)
- Docker and Docker Compose (optional)

### Local Development

1. **Set up CockroachDB locally**:

   ```bash
   # Using Docker
   docker run -d --name cockroach -p 26257:26257 cockroachdb/cockroach:latest start-single-node --insecure
   ```

2. **Configure the relay**:

   ```bash
   cp config.yaml.example config.yaml
   # Edit config.yaml with your database settings
   ```

3. **Run the relay**:

   ```bash
   go run ./cmd
   ```

## Testing

Run the test suite before submitting changes:

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run tests with coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Run specific NIP tests
cd tests/nips && ./test_nip01.sh
```

## Code Style

We follow the standard Go coding style. Use `gofmt` to format your code before committing.

Additional guidelines:

- Write clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Follow the existing project structure
